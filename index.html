            <h1>Vex Robotics Competition</h1>

            <h3>2017-2021</h3>

            <p>Vex Robotics Competition (VRC) is a competition where young engineers across the world build robots and compete against eachother following the rules of a game created each year by the VRC organization.</p>
              
            <p>I competed from grade 9 to grade 12, steadily improving my designing and building skills. i first made the BC provincials in grade 11, where my team made playoffs but lost in the first round after a disapointing performance. Despite winning various awards and competitions my team and I knew we had what it takes to compete internationally. The next year we fought fiercely at the highest level, ranking at 39th place in the world out of 10,000 teams. My role on this team was lead designer, lead builder, support programmer, main driver, and team captain; I played a central role in the success of the team as a whole. Ultimately we rose to competing at the world stage, however we lost during the playoffs at the Vex Worlds Competition.</p>

            <h1>Queen's Space Conference | Microscopic Space Debris Case Study</h1>

            <h3>Feb 2022</h3>

            <p>Queen’s Space Conference is a university run event that hosts prominent members of the space industry, and they speak about their experiences and research. The event also offers a case study event, where students work in randomly assigned teams to find a solution to a space related problem. </p>
               
            <p>The case study involved developing a solution to the issue of tiny metal particles in the orbital field of earth that are not being disposed of. My team’s solution involved using an expanding foam solution combined with an electromagnet to pull tiny metal particles into the foam where they would consolidate. Once enough material had been caught, the device would naturally fall into the Earth's atmosphere and burn up, as when an orbiting device gains mass, it's orbital radius gets smaller.</p>

            <h1>Vertical Farm</h1>

            <h3>Sep - Dec | 2021</h3>

            <p>As part of engineering coursework, students were tasked with designing a multi floor vertical farm including prototyping an elevator.</p>
               
            <p>My part of the project involved designing a pulley system and creating a code that controlled the elevator. I used a double pulley design with a counterweight to improve the efficiency of the elevator. The code was made using C++ using an Arduino to control the motor and sensors. The design used math to convert the rotary distance moved by the gears into linear distance moved by the elevator. Then the height of each floor was provided, and the number of rotations required by the motor was calculated and applied based on how many floors the elevator needed to travel. </p>

            <h1>Autonomous Rover LiDAR | Point Cloud</h1>

            <h3>Jan - April | 2022</h3>

            <p>Students were required to get engineering experience by solving an assigned problem for a stakeholder. My team and I were tasked with designing and building code in python to autonommously control a rover, which would be used by the Queen's Space Engineering Team (QSET). </p>

            <p>My part of the project involved taking LiDAR data (laser sensor that detects the distance and angle to objects) and processing it into a point cloud. Point clouds are a way of storing position information on a plane, identifying each individual point and finding the distance between each point and the next closest point. This creates an understanding of where the robot can move to, and which objects it needs to avoid.</p>

            <h3>Feb 2022</h3>

            <p>How to Change the World Conference is a week long case study competition which involves students from various universities working together to solve issues related to the Sustainable Development Goals. The conference if ran by the company How to Change the World, dedicated to educating students about engineering skills related to sustainaibility. The company was founded in University College London, and gradually spread universities around the world. </p>

            <p>My team focused on improving the transportation system in London, ON by introducing a monorail train system. We researched the maintenance costs of roads in Ontario, and found that there was a strong business case for implementing a monorail, as the initial costing would be outweighed by the maintenance costs that would be saved. We presented our case study to various stakeholders involved with development; we were even chosen to present to an individual currently in charge of a multi-billion dollar investment portfolio.</p>

            <h3>Jan - April | 2024</h3>

            <p>As part of a lab course, students were tasked with designing their own physics experiments.  </p>
                     
            <p>My team and I decided to experiment with small wavelengths of light produced by a machine called a Klystron. We used the Klystron as a transmitter in tandem with a microwave detecter to transmit bytes across the room with little interference. My part of the project involved turning sentences into bytes and sending them into the Klystron, and then decoding the messages when they were received by the detector.</p>

            <h1>Goniophotometer and Characterization</h1>

            <h3>Jan - April | 2024</h3>

            <p>For an optics course, students were tasked with building a simple goniophotometer, and characterizing a photodiode.  </p>
                     
            <p>My part of the project focused on the design and programming of the goniophotometer. The main components involved a step motor control, a 3d printed base, and a rotating piece. The design had a light source that was held in place using the base, and the rotating piece would rotate around the LED to get a profile of where the light was strongest. Note that real world goniophotometers rotate in two axes, whereas we only rotated in one axis for the scope of the project. </p>

            <p>To control the motor I used a method called wave drive. Step motors have phases, where each phase you want to activate one after the other, which forms a wave pattern. After creating a wave pattern, I recorded the time it took for a full rotation, and wrote a code so that the motor would record its angle, so that it could move to whichever angle specified. Then I wrote a command that rotated it from left to right while recording the voltage readings from the photodiode.</p>

            <p>I also worked with another teammate on building the characterization circuits. These were very complicated, as there were many components and small tweaks that needed to be made. The circuit used a low pass filter to slowly increase voltage; the circuitry causes the duty cycle (ratio of high voltage to low voltage from an AC source) to steadily increase. This results in a voltage vs time graph that resembles a right angle triangle.</p>
